# PowerShell-IoT - IS31FL3730 Driver

This repository has as main objective, replicate the [pimoroni's IS31FL3730 driver](https://github.com/pimoroni/scroll-phat/blob/master/library/scrollphat/IS31FL3730.py) to the PowerShell environment, using [PowerShell-IoT](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-IoT).

If you don't have PowerShell installed on your Raspberry, follow [this guide](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/installation/linux.md#raspbian) to do so.

After that, you need to install [PowerShell-IoT Module](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-IoT#installation)

Any suggestion/contribution is really welcome!
